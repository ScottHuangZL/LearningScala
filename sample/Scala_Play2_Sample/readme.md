Scala - Play2 framework - Samples
====================

**Note From Scott Huang: **
 - Start from early Nov,2015, include 3 small samples which consolidated in one bootstrap3 style main menu while I study below books.
 - "Play for Scala, Covers Play 2", "Play Framework Essentials", "Mastering Play Framework for Scala"
  
 
 ####[0. Download compiled result directly]( http://pan.baidu.com/s/1pJrexNd "Download compiled result directly from Baidu netdisk")
    download pass: ux56

    You need have Java 8 run time installed in advance. Please go to Oracle website to download JRE1.8.0_65 or above.
    Then you can unzip the downloaded compiled result to any folder, go to the bin sub folder, run the bat, then you can see web result from your  http://localhost:9000/
    Above give you a quick glance for how the result look like.  Anyway, I paste scree captures as below too.

	I would like recommend you install your Scala/Idea enviroment and run it from source code if you plan formal study Scala/Play2.
	You can download Scala from http://www.scala-lang.org/documentation/  and download activator, which is an enhanced SBT(Standard/Simple Build Tool), 
	You can use SBT  http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html , it is quite small if you not like activator.
	After that, please go to my sample root folder, and use "activator run"  or "sbt run" to run the web.
	Btw, you can go to activator root folder and use "activator ui" to start main ui, which can allow you create more samples which provided from Typesafe company.
	
	You can change langurage from Chinese（中文） to English（英文） by edit the conf/application.conf file to change application.langs="zh-CN"  to application.langs="en" in case you start web from "sbt run", thanks.
